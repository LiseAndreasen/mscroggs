The number 36 is equal to two times the product of its digits.

36, 2 * 3 * 6 = 36

What is the only (strictly positive) number that is equal to four times the product of its digits?

Assume 3 digit number, abc

abc = 4 * a * b * c
100a + 10b + c = 4 * a * b * c

None of the digits can be 0
The digits must be the same, otherwise there would be more than 1 permutation

Test:

111, 4 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 4
25 <= a * b * c
222, 4 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32
333, 4 * 3^3 = 108
Hm.

Oh. Wrong that the digits must be the same
