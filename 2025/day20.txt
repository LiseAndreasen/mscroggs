A number is called a perfect power if it is equal to n^k for some integer n and some integer k > 1. 2025 is a perfect power (45^2) and 23 more than 2025 is also a perfect power (2^11).
What is the only three-digit perfect power that is 29 less than another perfect power?

Write a program.

The higher of these 2 perfect powers is less than 1000 + 29
k is at most 10, 2^10 = 1024, 3^9 is too much.
n is at most 32, 32^2 = 1024

196

Oh. There was actually an easier way to find this.
(a + 1)^2 = a^2 + 2a + 1
2a + 1 = 29
a = 14
a^2 = 196

The puzzle tells us this is the only way.
