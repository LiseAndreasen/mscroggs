In a 3 by 5 grid of squares, if a line is drawn from the bottom left corner to the top right corner, it will pass through 7 squares:
In a 251 by 272 grid of squares, how many squares will a line drawn from the bottom left corner to the top right corner pass through?

251: prime
272: 2^4 * 17

Does the line go through any already existing corners? No, as one of the numbers is prime.

Result: 251 + 272 - 1 = 522
