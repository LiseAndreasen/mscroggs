Some numbers can be written as the sum of four consecutive numbers, for example: 142 = 34 + 35 + 36 + 37.
What is the mean of all the three-digit numbers that can be written as the sum of four consecutive numbers?

Sum of 4 consec number:
a + a+1 + a+2 + a+3
4a + 6
4(a+1) + 2
This number is divided by 2, but not 4.

Lowest possible:
102

Highest possible:
998

The mean:

(102+998)/2 = 550

(Yes, these aren't the only possible numbers. But the rest won't change the mean.)
