Mary uses the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 to make two three-digit numbers and a one-digit number (using each digit exactly once). The sum of her three numbers is 1000.
What is the smallest that the larger of her two three-digit numbers could be?

 abc
 def
   g
----
1000

c+f+g=10

1+b+e=10

1+a+d=10

a+d=9
b+e=9

2+7=9
3+6=0
4+5=9

1 has to be in the last column

Ha!

c+f+g=10
One of them is 1
1+f+g=9
